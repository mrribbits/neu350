Two psychopy scripts:
fish-stimuli.py: rotating checkerboard (radial stimulus) in a 20sec on/off block design for 4 minutes. 

checkerboard.py: full field flickering checkboard in a 20sec on/off block design for 4 minutes.

EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPy.py: required in working directory for eye tracking to work.

Prisma_config_1.py: config file for Prisma to set the monitor dimensions, gamma, and eye tracking defaults.

Skyra_config_1.py: similar config file but for Skyra.

Note: Must install the visionscience plugin in Psychopy for the radial stimulus to function (Tools->Package Manager->psychopy-visionsicence).
